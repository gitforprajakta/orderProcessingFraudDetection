# NimbusMart — Serverless E-Commerce + ML Fraud Detection

A full-stack AWS-native e-commerce demo where every order flows through a real
event-driven fraud-detection pipeline powered by an XGBoost model running
inside AWS Lambda.

- React + Vite frontend hosted on AWS Amplify
- Real Cognito sign-up / login / email verification with admin & customer roles
- DynamoDB-backed product catalog, cart, and order history
- API Gateway + Lambda services for products, cart, orders, admin, uploads
- Atomic stock decrements at checkout (no overselling)
- EventBridge fan-out: OrderCreated → Fraud Lambda → FraudDecision → Notification + Stock-Restore
- XGBoost model trained locally, exported to JSON, evaluated in pure Python in Lambda
- S3 bucket + presigned uploads for product images
- SNS topic for order-decision notifications (APPROVE / BLOCK / REVIEW), with up to 3 admin emails auto-subscribed
- SQS `OrderReviewQueue` (with DLQ) holds every REVIEW order until an admin approves or blocks it
- CloudWatch logs for every Lambda

Admin reviews a queued order:
   AdminLambda  GET  /admin/review-queue           ◄── pulls messages from SQS
   AdminLambda  POST /admin/orders/{id}/decision   ──► updates DDB
                                                   ──► EventBridge OrderApproved/Blocked
                                                   ──► deletes the SQS message

S3 (product images) ◄── public read for catalog images
```

## Demo accounts (auto-created on stack deploy)

| Role     | Email                  | Password             |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Customer | `testuser@example.com` | `YourSecurePassw0rd!`|
| Admin    | `admin@example.com`    | `AdminPassw0rd!`     |

You can also sign up new accounts from the React app — verification emails are
sent automatically by Cognito.

```

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with credentials and a region (e.g. `us-west-1`)
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+ (only needed if you want to retrain XGBoost locally)

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-1
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-1
```

## 1. (Optional) Retrain XGBoost from your CSV

The repository already ships with model artifacts under
`services/fraud_service/artifacts/`. Re-run this only if you want to update
them:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ml/requirements-ml.txt

python ml/train_xgboost_local.py --csv "/path/to/synthetic_fraud_dataset.csv"
```

This regenerates:

- `services/fraud_service/artifacts/xgb_model.json`
- `services/fraud_service/artifacts/inference_spec.json`

Lambda packages those JSON files at deploy time.

## 2. Deploy the backend (CDK)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npx cdk synth          # validates the stack

# Bootstrap once per AWS account/region:
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
npx cdk bootstrap aws://${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/${AWS_REGION}

npx cdk deploy
```

To pre-subscribe up to three admin emails to the SNS notifications topic
during the deploy (recommended), pass them via the `adminEmails` CDK
context (comma-separated). Each address gets a one-click confirmation
email from AWS:

```bash
npx cdk deploy -c adminEmails="alice@example.com,bob@example.com,carol@example.com"
```

You can also subscribe / unsubscribe later via the AWS console or the CLI
snippet in step 7.

Useful outputs:

| Output                       | Used by                        |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `ApiUrl`                     | Frontend `VITE_API_URL`        |
| `CognitoUserPoolId`          | Frontend `VITE_USER_POOL_ID`   |
| `CognitoUserPoolClientId`    | Frontend `VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID` |
| `AwsRegion`                  | Frontend `VITE_AWS_REGION`     |
| `ProductImagesBucketName`    | S3 bucket hosting catalog images |
| `OrdersTableName`            | DynamoDB                       |
| `ProductsTableName`          | DynamoDB                       |
| `CartsTableName`             | DynamoDB                       |
| `OrderNotificationsTopicArn` | Subscribe email for APPROVE / BLOCK / REVIEW alerts |
| `ReviewQueueUrl`             | SQS queue URL holding REVIEW orders |
| `ReviewQueueArn`             | SQS queue ARN                  |
| `ReviewQueueDlqUrl`          | DLQ for failed review messages |
| `AdminEmailsSubscribed`      | Echo of `-c adminEmails=` value used at deploy |

Re-fetch outputs anytime:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name OrderProcessingFraudDetectionStack \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[*].[OutputKey,OutputValue]" \
  --output table
```

The deploy automatically:

- Seeds 10 sample products into DynamoDB
- Creates the demo customer + admin Cognito users and assigns groups

## 3. Configure and run the frontend

The React app reads configuration from Vite env vars. For local dev, create
`frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://xxx.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-west-1
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=us-west-1_xxxxxxxx
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

Or build for static hosting:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build        # output in frontend/dist
npm run preview      # local preview of the production build
```

## 4. Deploy the frontend to Amplify

### Option A — Connect your Git repository (recommended)

1. AWS Console → **Amplify** → **Host web app** → connect this repo.
2. Amplify auto-detects `amplify.yml`. Confirm and continue.
3. Add the four `VITE_*` environment variables in Amplify (App settings →
   Environment variables) using the CDK outputs.
4. Add a **Rewrite rule** so client-side routing works (App settings →
   Rewrites and redirects → "Rewrites and redirects" tab):

   | Source | Target | Type |
   |--------|--------|------|
   | `</^[^.]+$\|\.(?!(css\|gif\|ico\|jpg\|js\|png\|txt\|svg\|woff\|woff2\|ttf\|map\|json\|webp)$)([^.]+$)/>` | `/index.html` | `200 (Rewrite)` |

5. Trigger a build. Open the Amplify URL.

### Option B — Manual zip upload

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd dist
zip -r ../../frontend-static.zip .
```

Drag-and-drop `frontend-static.zip` into Amplify "Deploy without Git provider".
Add the rewrite rule above.

## 5. Try it end-to-end

1. Open the Amplify URL.
2. Click **Sign up**, register a new email (or sign in as the demo customer).
3. Click any product → **Add to cart** → **Checkout**.
4. Pick a country/postal that drives the desired fraud decision (see below)
   and click **Place order**.
5. The order page polls every 2 seconds and shows the final decision once
   Fraud Lambda finishes scoring.

### Predictable fraud-rule examples

| Product           | Country | Likely outcome |
|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| BOOK-1 (Books)    | US      | APPROVE        |
| TABLET-1 ×1       | US      | REVIEW         |
| LAPTOP-1 ×6       | IN      | BLOCK          |

Rules layered on top of XGBoost:

- base 0.05
- `+0.25` if order total > $500
- `+0.35` if order total > $1500
- `+0.20` if shipping country not US/CA
- `+0.15` if total quantity ≥ 5

Decision thresholds: `<0.30` APPROVE, `0.30–0.70` REVIEW, `≥0.70` BLOCK.

The final score is `max(xgboost_probability, rules_score)` so demo orders are
deterministic regardless of model drift.

## 6. Admin workflow

1. Sign in as `admin@example.com` (`AdminPassw0rd!`).
2. Click **Admin** in the navbar.
3. **Inventory** tab — add, edit, soft-delete products, upload images to S3
   directly from the form.
4. **Orders** tab — filter by status (default `REVIEW`), click **Approve** or
   **Block** to override fraud decisions. Block events automatically restore
   stock via `stock_restore_service`.
5. **Review Queue** tab — every order the fraud model marks as `REVIEW` is
   pushed onto the `OrderReviewQueue` SQS queue, and an SNS email goes out
   to all subscribed admins. The first admin to open this tab pulls the
   message (visibility timeout makes it temporarily invisible to the others
   to avoid double-handling) and clicks **Approve** or **Block**. That:

   - Updates the order's `status` in DynamoDB
   - Emits an `OrderApproved` / `OrderBlocked` EventBridge event (which
     triggers another SNS email and, for Block, the stock-restore Lambda)
   - **Deletes the message from the SQS queue** using the receipt handle
     returned by `GET /admin/review-queue`

## 7. SNS email subscriptions for the three admins

The recommended path is to pass the three admin emails when you deploy
the stack so CDK creates and manages the subscriptions:

```bash
npx cdk deploy -c adminEmails="alice@example.com,bob@example.com,carol@example.com"
```

To add or change subscribers later without redeploying:

```bash
export TOPIC_ARN=<OrderNotificationsTopicArn>

aws sns subscribe \
  --topic-arn "$TOPIC_ARN" \
  --protocol email \
  --notification-endpoint your-email@example.com
```

Confirm the subscription email. Every APPROVE / BLOCK / REVIEW decision is
emailed, including the second notification that fires when an admin
approves or blocks a queued order from the **Review Queue** tab.

## 8. Logs

```bash
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-OrderLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-FraudLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-NotificationLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-ProductsLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-CartLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-MyOrdersLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-AdminLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-UploadLambda" --since 10m
aws logs tail "/aws/lambda/OrderProcessingFraudDetection-StockRestoreLambda" --since 10m
```

## 9. Cleanup

```bash
npx cdk destroy
```

Generated local files that should not be committed:

- `.venv/`
- `cdk.out/`
- `node_modules/`
- `frontend/node_modules/`
- `frontend/dist/`
- `ml/artifacts/local_xgb/`

## API surface

Public:

- `GET  /products`                   list active products (`?category=` filter)
- `GET  /products/{sku}`             get one product

Customer-authenticated:

- `GET    /cart`                     read my cart
- `DELETE /cart`                     clear my cart
- `POST   /cart/items`               add `{sku, qty}`
- `PUT    /cart/items/{sku}`         set qty
- `DELETE /cart/items/{sku}`         remove item
- `POST   /orders`                   place order from cart-resolved items
- `GET    /me/orders`                my order history
- `GET    /me/orders/{orderId}`      one of my orders

Admin-only (`cognito:groups` must contain `admins`):

- `POST   /products`                 create product
- `PUT    /products/{sku}`           update product
- `DELETE /products/{sku}`           soft-delete product
- `GET    /admin/orders`             list all orders (`?status=` filter)
- `POST   /admin/orders/{id}/decision` `{decision: "APPROVE" | "BLOCK", receiptHandle?: string}`
  – when `receiptHandle` is present (returned by `/admin/review-queue`),
  the matching message is deleted from the SQS queue.
- `GET    /admin/review-queue`       pull pending REVIEW messages from SQS
  (`?max=1..10`, default 10). Each entry includes `receiptHandle`,
  `orderId`, `score`, and the order record from DynamoDB.
- `POST   /uploads/product-image`    presigned S3 PUT URL for `{filename, contentType}`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| `cdk deploy` fails | `npm install`, `npm run build`, then `npx cdk synth` |
| Sign-up email never arrives | Cognito sandbox limits sending to verified addresses; in production move out of sandbox |
| API returns `401` | Token expired (Amplify auto-refreshes; sign in again as a fallback) |
| API returns `403` on `/admin/*` | The user is not in the `admins` group |
| Order stays `PENDING` | Check Fraud Lambda logs and EventBridge rule `OnOrderCreated` |
| Browser CORS error | Redeploy CDK; verify the Amplify rewrite rule is set |
| Image upload fails | Bucket public-read configured in CDK; check Upload Lambda CloudWatch logs |
| React route 404 on refresh | Add the SPA rewrite rule in the Amplify Console (see step 4) |
